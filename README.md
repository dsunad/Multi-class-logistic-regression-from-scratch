# Multi-class-logistic-regression-from-scratch
This algorithm is designed to deal with the weighted likelihood function mentioned in the paper "LOCAL UNCERTAINTY SAMPLING FOR LARGE-SCALE
MULTI-CLASS LOGISTIC REGRESSION", it is a multi-class logistic regression algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation(MLE). As far as I know, this is the first
MLE based algorithm online.
